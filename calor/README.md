”Health is wealth” Obviously, you have heard it a thousand times but as we grow
older we often realize it’s true and this app provides an interesting way to get
started with the very boring term “dieting” as we already know “FITNESS START
WITH WHAT WE EAT”.

Let’s develop an interesting project – Calorie Calculator to record and estimate
number of calories we need to consume daily. This app can also provide
guidelines for gaining or losing weight.
