# Mastering Django with simple projects

Learning the concept of Python and Django is a great experience. But only theoretical learning is not enough, but working on some real-time projects would help integrating all of our concepts, we now need project ideas.

There is no better way to learn Django or any other framework than by working on some real-world projects. Projects are essential to make learning easy for us. These projects will help us gain real-world experience and make us ready to deliver great products.
