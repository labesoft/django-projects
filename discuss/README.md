![img.png](img.png)

Discussion Forum is a place (a website) that enables people to post views 
over a certain topic publically and also allows to see other’s opinions on 
the same. Let’s see how we can actually make this interesting Django project.

To make it more interesting, we’ll allow the user to post anonymously, 
though, this could be risky these days.

framework: Django which provides many inbuilt functionalities and thus make

it to develop any kind of project be it an E-commerce website or a simple 
Discussion Forum.
