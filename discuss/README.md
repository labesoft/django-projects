Discussion Forum is a place (a website) that enables people to post views 
over a certain topic publicly and also allows to see other’s opinions on 
the same. Let’s see how we can actually make this interesting Django project.

To make it more interesting, we’ll allow the user to post anonymously, 
though, this could be risky these days.

## About the project

We’ll develop this interesting python project using a very popular python 
framework: Django which provides many inbuilt functionalities and thus make 
our work much simpler and less time-consuming.

Django is a Python-based, free, open-source web framework that we can use to 
develop any kind of project be it an E-commerce website or a simple 
Discussion Forum.
